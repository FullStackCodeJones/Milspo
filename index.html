    <h1>Milspo: Giving You What’s Truly Needed as a New Military Spouse</h1>

    <p>
      Being away from the people we love is no easy task—especially when it’s
      our spouse. Not too long ago, I had to watch my husband of only one year
      leave for basic training. And while I am extremely proud of him for going
      after a dream he’s had since high school, I was also sad to see him go.
      <strong>Sad is an understatement—I was DISTRAUGHT.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      That time was tough. Mentally. Physically. Emotionally. Financially.
      Spiritually. But somehow, I made it through. I’m grateful—not just for the
      strength I found in myself— but for the reassurance and love he’s
      continued to give me.

      There are so many online communities that claim to help... but let's be
      honest: there's a whole lot of “Negative Nancys” out there. They’ll hit
      you with “Just be patient” or “No news is good news”— but when you’re in
      the thick of it, those words don’t help. Not really.
