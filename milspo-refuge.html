      <h1>Hey New Milspo. How you doin'?</h1>
      <h3>Yeah... I know. FELT</h3>
      <br />
      <h2>The Pain I Feltüíî</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        When he left, it felt like my heart was literally being ripped out of my
        chest. I couldn't sleep for a while without him. I had little to no
        appetite. I barely had a fake smile in me but I tried to smile anyway,
        for the kids... I cried in the shower so no one would hear my sobs. Very
        much one of the hardest things that I have ever had to do.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>The Thought's I Couldn't Share</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you haven't already heard, you're supposed to be so strong for them
        and never write them about how you're feeling if you are sad, or upset,
        or scared.. Nothing negative. DON'T YOU DARE. Don't you dare be human
        and want to vent to your best friend. They belong to the Department Of
        Defense now, and they don't need to be boggled down with your silly
        civilian emotions. *Insert heavy eye roll/side eye* Such BULL. Basically
        suck it up buttercup. If you love them then you'll grit and bare it.
        What about us though? At least that's where my mind went. I questioned
        EVERYTHING. Was I strong enough for this life? Would he change(and not
        in a good way)? Would he forget about me? Was I being dramatic(all of
        those *seasoned* military parents and spouses would certainly say so)?
        Sometimes I wanted to scream, but I didn't want to seem ungrateful,
        everyone says to be happy for this rare opportunity, "an opportunity of
        a lifetime". I wanted to be proud and supportive and believe me I AM,
        but I was also lonely and scared. Oh and don't get me started on the
        horror stories, quick tip.. please stay of of those military spouse
        groups. Did I say that already? Even if I did, it is worth repeating.
        Trust me on this one!

      <h2>The Spiritual Anchoring</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you are religious, spiritual or agnostic... Listen. You're going
        to end up turning to whatever you believe in. Me? I clung to faith,
        meditation, prayer, wine... Yes wine, religiously. I clung to moments of
        peace wherever I could find them. Sometimes that meant just breathing
        and surviving the day, the hour, the minute really. Somtimes all I could
        do is cry out to The Creator, whoever or whatever is up there guiding us
        through all of this. Sometimes I couldn't even do that, I'd just light a
        candle. I found myself constantly praying for him and his safety and for
        our love to either stay the same or better yet grow into something even
        more beautiful than it already was.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>The Strength I Didn't Know I Had</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Slowly, I started to rebuild. I remembered who I was before the fear,
        before the pain. I started choosing joy in all the small ways, started
        doing self care a lot more, working out, speaking affirmations over
        myself, our marriage, my husband, our family. I started journaling,
        learning how to love myself while loving him from afar, and I realized,
        I am far from broken, I am building.
      </p>
      <h2>You're Going To Be Ok and I Mean That In The Kindest Way</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          If you're reading this and you are feeling like you're drowning in all
          of the emotions, know that I have been there, and I made it through
          and so will you. Granted, our journey is not over, and there will
          still be days where it may seem like literal HELL because we miss
          them. Know that you are strong and you are seen. I know, you're scared
          but you're not alone anymore. Welcome to Milspo!
